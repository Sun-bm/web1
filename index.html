    <p style="margin_top: 40px;"><b>WEB</b> is an information system where documents
       and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
      which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the Web
       are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application
     called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not
     synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies
     the Web is built.

    <p style="margin_top: 40px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">E</b>nglish scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World
     Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The browser
     was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in
     August 1991. The Web began to enter everyday use in 1993-4, when websites for general use started to become available.
     The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age, and is the primary tool billions of
     people use to interact on the Internet.</p>
    <p style="margin_top: 40px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">W</b>eb resources may be any type of downloaded media,
      but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Special HTML syntax
      displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs which permits users to navigate to other web resources. In addition to
      text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and software components which are either displayed
      or internally executed in the user's web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia content.</p>
    <p style="margin_top: 40px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">M</b>ultiple web resources with a common theme
      and usually a common domain name, make up a website. Websites are stored in computers that are running
      a web server, which is a program that responds to requests made over the Internet from web browsers running
      on a user's computer. Website content can be provided by a publisher, or interactively from user-generated
      content. Websites are provided for a myriad of informative, entertainment, commercial, and governmental reasons.</p>
