    <p style="margin_top: 40px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">JavaScript</b>,
      often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
      ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
      compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

    <p style="margin_top: 40px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">A</b>longside HTML
      and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
      JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
      applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page
      behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
      execute it.</p>
    <p style="margin_top: 40px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">A</b>s a multi-paradigm
      language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not
      include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
      facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

    <p style="margin_top: 40px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">J</b>avaScript engines
      were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in
      some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of
      applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.</p>
    <p style="margin_top: 40px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">A</b>lthough there
      are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name,
      syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct
      and differ greatly in design.</p>
